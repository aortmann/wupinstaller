DO NOT INSTALL SYSTEM TITLES WITH THIS, ONLY INSTALL GAMES, APPS, DLC OR YOU WILL BRICK

This homebrew allows you to install full games (so you can play online), DLC, applications, but it have to be downloaded from NUS, if you do not download them from NUS it will brick

Wii U Modified WUPInstaller for 5.5.X and under

So, this is just the [USER=152747]@dimok[/USER] HBL version of WUP Installer, i have deleted the Title ID Check, so now you can install everything you find on NUS.

I just tested it with YouTube.

I didn't made this homebrew it is just a modified version of a HBL port.
